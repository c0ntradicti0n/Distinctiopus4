{"sentence": "Things are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. On the other hand, things are said to be named 'univocally' which have both the name and the definition answering to the name in common."}
{"sentence": "Oxidation refers to oxidizing of a compound in the presence of enzymes and molecular oxygen while fermentation refers to the transformation of sugars to acids and alcohols in the presence of enzymes and absence of molecular oxygen."}
{"sentence": "Oxidases catalyze oxidation reactions while lactic acid dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde decarboxylase and ethanol dehydrogenase catalyze fermentation."}
{"sentence": "Oxidation is important in the tea industry for the production of polyphenols; in aerobic organisms, it is necessary for the production of energy. On the other hand, fermentation is important in many industrial processes such as dairy industry, bakery industry and alcohol industry, to generate energy in the exercising muscles, etc."}
{"sentence": "Things are said to be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. Thus, a real man and a figure in a picture can both lay claim to the name 'animal'; yet these are equivocally so named, for, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each. For should anyone define in what sense each is an animal, his definition in the one case will be appropriate to that case only. On the other hand, things are said to be named 'univocally' which have both the name and the definition answering to the name in common. A man and an ox are both 'animal', and these are univocally so named, inasmuch as not only the name, but also the definition, is the same in both cases: for if a man should state in what sense each is an animal, the statement in the one case would be identical with that in the other."}
